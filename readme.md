# Docker Compose for Jenkins with DinD

**Project: Docker Compose for Jenkins with DinD**

This repository provides a Docker Compose configuration (`docker-compose.yaml`) for running Jenkins with a Docker-in-Docker (DinD) runtime, allowing you to manage Jenkins and its Docker environment efficiently.

**Requirements**

- Docker Engine (tested with version 20 or later)
- Docker Compose (tested with version 3.7 or later)

**Installation**

1.  Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ifeLight/docker-compose-jenkins-dind.git](https://github.com/ifeLight/docker-compose-jenkins-dind.git)
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd docker-compose-jenkins-dind
    ```

3.  Start the Jenkins container(s) using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This will start both the `jenkins_docker` (DinD) and `jenkins` services.

**Accessing Jenkins**

Once the containers are running, you can access the Jenkins web interface at:

- http://localhost:8080 (default port)

**Configuration**

The `docker-compose.yaml` file defines the following services:

- **jenkins_docker:** This service uses the official Docker image (`docker:dind`) to provide a Docker runtime environment within the container. It includes necessary configuration for privileged access and secure communication with the Jenkins container.
- **jenkins:** This service builds a custom Jenkins image based on the `myjenkins-blueocean:2.462.3-1` image (replace with your actual image name if different). It then installs the `blueocean` and `docker-workflow` plugins for enhanced functionality. The build process also configures Jenkins to use the `docker_jenkins` service as the Docker daemon host.

**Data Persistence**

The `jenkins_data` volume persists Jenkins data, including plugins and configurations, even if the container restarts.

**Security**

This configuration uses TLS certificates to secure communication between the `jenkins` container and the `jenkins_docker` service. The `jenkins_docker_cert` volume stores the certificates.

**Customization**

- You can customize the `myjenkins-blueocean` image name or build your own Jenkins image in the `Dockerfile`.
- Modify environment variables in the `jenkins` service section to configure Jenkins settings further. Refer to the official Jenkins documentation for available options: [invalid URL removed]

**Additional Notes**

- Consider using a dedicated Docker network for improved isolation between containers (adjust the `networks` section in `docker-compose.yaml`).
- For production use, evaluate additional security measures like Docker secrets or environment variables to manage sensitive information like credentials.
